We love Google! Serving the web, and our geocoders, for quite some years. Especially their generic geocoding results fit the bill. However, for the more detailed requests, it might be better to integrate high quality, official data sources. We can think about building and address registration straight from the Dutch Land Registry Office or address information of local business directly connected to the chamber of commerce.

# Data sources

To create a rich and high-quality webservice we (Calendar42 & Stichting OpenGeo) developed a prototype which is based on an integration of the following data sources:

* Basis registratie Adressen en Gebouwen, made freely available via [Geon](http://geon.nl/) (Thanks for that!)
* Basis registratie Handelsregister (via [openkvk](http://www.openkvk.nl/))
* Wijken en Buurten 2010 (via [CBS](http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/dossiers/nederland-regionaal/publicaties/geografische-data/archief/2011/2011-wijk-en-buurtkaart-2010-art.htm))
* Provinciegrenzen 2003 (via [OpenStreetMap](http://mirror.openstreetmap.nl/bestuurlijkegrenzen/))
* Busstop locations of Grenzeloze Openbaar Vervoer Informatie ([GOVI](http://govi.nu/)), Connexxion, Syntus, Arriva, RET, Veolia (via [openOV](http://openov.nl/))
 
# Audience
This webservice is released in the pulic domain to support developers of location based services with a geograhic scope on the Netherlands. We specifically work towards a system that supports both static and dynamic (e.g. from interface elements) geocoding.

# Vision
The ultimate goal of Bag42 is to create a Linked Open Data Geocoding service to public transport data, chamber of commerce data and building and address data.
